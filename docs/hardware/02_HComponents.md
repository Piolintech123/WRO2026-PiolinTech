## 3. Evolutionary Timeline

### Version 1 (Phase 1.0: Prototype Chassis)
The initial prototype utilized a standard LEGO Technic chassis driven by the EV3 Brick. The primary limitation was structural compliance; plastic snap-pin connectors allowed for significant chassis twist under steering torque, causing erratic behavior on the track.

### Version 2 (Phase 1.5: LEGO SPIKE Stabilization)
To address the structural flex identified in Phase 1, the frame was rebuilt using cross-braced LEGO SPIKE Prime beams, creating a rigid overhead bridge structure. This successfully eliminated vertical chassis twist and established a stable, fully LEGO ecosystem.

### Version 3 (Current Integrated Configuration)
The current active configuration implements an integrated sensor fusion paradigm. We preserved the rigid SPIKE Prime box-frame structure for compliance and modularity, while leveraging the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick to process a sophisticated sensor array. By integrating the PixyCam for real-time computer vision, alongside the precision gyro, ultrasonic, and color sensors, we achieved high-fidelity telemetry, responsive obstacle detection, and accurate lane tracking.

## 4. Engineering Achievements & Control Logic

*   **Asynchronous Sensor Fusion:** We have optimized the Pybricks environment to run an asynchronous polling loop. This allows the EV3 to read the PixyCam vision data, gyro heading, and ultrasonic distances concurrently, minimizing latency between visual input and motor output.
*   **PID Control Loop:** Steering is governed by a PID loop that utilizes the gyro and color sensor data as primary feedback. This ensures that the robot maintains a stable heading even when the track geometry changes rapidly.
*   **Predictive Maneuvering:** By fusing the ultrasonic sensor data with vision inputs, the robot can anticipate upcoming track segments, allowing it to initiate evasive maneuvers or tighten steering arcs before an obstacle is even fully in view.
